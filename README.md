For this homework assignment, we were tasked to with producing a one day calendar, divided by the hours, with the option of saving or in my case booking a particular hour selected from the day.  I used military, as I new it would be easier to for me to determine the greater than less than values I would need to use in the if else statements.  Numbers can at times be confusing when you're already flustered. LOL.  This assignment did give us a base code of CSS and HTML, which I did slightly modify to make it a little more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. 
The planner used a decent amount of JavaScript, utilizing both JQuery and moment.js which are both newer programming languages to me, but the more effective when making a dynamic webpage. I really enjoy how JQuery simplifies the JavaScript syntax.  Much   With these dynamic functions, the page becomes much more user friendly and offers more selection in what you want to actually to do with it.
This assignment has made me a bit more comfortable and with the use of the setItem method for storing user provided information in the local storage.  Looking forward to being able to pass such information on through the API in future class projects.  
This project was enjoyable, cause as grueling and frustrating it is to test code, it's is such a sense accomplishment when the application actually works as I planned.  I do in fact, have a tutor.  And he has certainly been a godsent when I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and stumped on particular steps.  I really seem to overthink simple mistakes.
Included in this README is a screenshot of the web application as well as a link to a clip I filmed. A similar URL is in the config file from GoogleDocs
